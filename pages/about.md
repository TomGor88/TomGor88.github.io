<!-- # Portfolio Jekyll Theme

This is a personal portfolio theme that I built from the ground up, using the [DevTips Starter Kit](http://devtipsstarterkit.com/) as a foundation for starting, and following closely the amazing tutorial by [Travis Neilson over at DevTips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6jKLsxbFg4&list=PL0CB3OvPhDA_STygmp3sDenx3UpdOMk7P). You can [check out the demo](lenpaul.github.io/portfolio-jekyll-theme/), and [fork the repository](https://github.com/LeNPaul/portfolio-jekyll-theme/fork), to get started. -->

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi! I am a third-year Mechanical Engineering student at the University of California, San Diego, specializing in Controls and Robotics.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a strong foundation in STEM and a passion for multidisciplinary innovation, I am actively seeking internship opportunities to apply my technical skills, collaborate on real-world engineering challenges, and contribute to cutting-edge solutions in robotics, medical devices, 3d printing, automation, and related fields.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I’m not working on a project or knee-deep in a design sketch, I’m probably out playing sports. I love road biking and exploring new trails—there’s something about being in nature that helps me reset. I’m also part of the UCSD Badminton Team, and this past winter, we proudly reached Division One Nationals.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On quieter days, I enjoy photography, especially capturing moments in sports and landscapes. I’m also a big fan of live music and have a soft spot for late-night jazz playlists, especially while working on engineering drawings.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe in staying curious, slowing down sometimes, and always making time for the things that bring joy.
